To spoon or not to spoon, that is the question.
A good spoon makes your life easier.
You make your own luck if you use the spoon.
Have a sit, grab a spoon.
Just because the spoon is great, doesn't mean the slurp should be loud.
With a great spoon comes great responsibility.
Don't just sit there, use your spoon, and stir things up.
