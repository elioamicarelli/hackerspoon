# Names from the Books of Angels

It's worth noting that while the series is called "Book of Angels," the names themselves are almost exclusively drawn from demonology and texts on magic, referring to fallen angels, demons, and great dukes of Hell. Here is a short description for each:

**Astaroth**: A high-ranking Duke of Hell, often depicted as a foul angel riding a dragon. He is said to give true answers about the past, present, and future.

**Azazel**: A fallen angel who taught forbidden knowledge to humanity, leading to their corruption. He is a leader of the Watchers, a group of fallen angels.

**Malphas**: A great President of Hell who appears as a raven. He can build houses and high towers and can reveal the thoughts of enemies.

**Orobas**: A powerful Great Prince of Hell who appears as a horse. He is faithful to the conjurer, gives true answers, and protects from other spirits.

**Balan** (or Balam): A great and powerful king of Hell with three heads (a bull, a man, and a ram). He gives answers about the past, present, and future and can make men invisible and witty.

**Moloch**: A fallen angel associated with fire and child sacrifice. He is a powerful and warlike figure in Hell.

**Asmodeus**: A king of demons, known as the demon of lust. He was once a Cherubim angel before he fell.

**Volac** (or Valak): A Great President of Hell who appears as a child with angel wings, riding a two-headed dragon. He can reveal the location of hidden treasures and serpents.

**Xaphan**: A demon of the second rank who proposed setting fire to heaven during the angelic rebellion. He is now condemned to stoke the fires of Hell.

**Lucifer**: The most beautiful of all angels who, full of pride, rebelled against God and was cast out of heaven, becoming the ruler of Hell.

**Zaebos**: A Grand Count of Hell, depicted as a handsome soldier riding a crocodile. He is said to cause love between men and women.

**Stolas**: A Great Prince of Hell who appears as a crowned owl. He teaches astronomy and the knowledge of herbs and precious stones.

**Mycale**: I could not find a description for an angel or demon with this name. The album was performed by the vocal group Mycale, so it's likely named after them.

**Ipos**: An Earl and Prince of Hell who appears as an angel with a lion's head. He can reveal the past, present, and future and make men witty and bold.

**Baal**: A powerful king of Hell, often depicted with three heads (a cat, a toad, and a man). He can make men invisible and grant wisdom.

**Tap**: I could not find a description for an angel or demon with this name. The album was performed by guitarist Pat Metheny, and "Tap" may be a reference to his style of playing.

**Cerberus**: The three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the entrance to the Underworld. Not an angel or demon from Judeo-Christian tradition.
