# The Rise of Friendslop

"Friendslop" is an internet-originated term used to describe a video game genre characterized by low-budget, low-stakes, and often humorous co-op experiences designed primarily for playing with friends. These games typically feature simple objectives, goofy mechanics such as proximity chat or unusual physics engines, and are frequently indie titles. The core appeal lies in the shared experience and emergent gameplay that arises from playing with others, rather than intricate narratives or highly polished mechanics.

## Mount Your Friends (2014)

Developed and published by Stegersaurus Software Inc., *Mount Your Friends* was released in July 2014. Originally developed at the eighth Toronto Games Jam in 2013, its development period was relatively short. This physics-based competitive climbing game challenges players to reach the highest point on a tower made of other players (and a goat), controlling each limb individually. Its intentionally clumsy mechanics lead to hilarious and often absurd situations, making it a quintessential "Friendslop" experience. While specific revenue figures for the original game are not readily available, its 3D sequel, "Mount Your Friends 3D: A Hard Man is Good to Climb," has an estimated gross revenue of $219,000. Its unique blend of simple objectives and goofy physics carved out a niche and became a cult classic, celebrated for its couch co-op hilarity.

## Quiplash (2015)

Developed and published by Jackbox Games, Inc., *Quiplash* was first released in June 2015. This party game involves 3-8 players answering humorous prompts on their phones or tablets, with other players and an audience voting for the funniest or most clever responses. With no "correct" answers and a strong emphasis on player creativity and social interaction, *Quiplash* perfectly embodies the low-stakes, high-hilarity spirit of "Friendslop." Its success has spawned multiple sequels and variations, establishing it as a go-to title for group gatherings and online streams, primarily due to its accessible, inclusive, and endlessly repeatable gameplay that thrives on emergent humor.
