# The Rise of Gambling Roguelikes

Over the last few years, we have witnessed the rise of 'Gambling Roguelikes': indie titles that synthesize the visceral thrill of games of chance with the calculated progression of traditional roguelikes. By balancing the dopamine rush of chance games against strategic depth, developers have created a sub-genre defined by risk, reward, and high replayability. Below are the standout titles that emerged from my analysis of the genre's recent evolution.

### Slay the Spire (2019)

While not thematically a gambling game, *Slay the Spire* is arguably the foundational blueprint for the entire modern deck-building roguelike genre, including many of the titles on this list. Its inclusion is crucial because its core mechanics are deeply rooted in the same principles of strategic risk and probability management that define gambling. The central gameplay loop involves drawing a random hand of cards from a deck you construct, forcing players to constantly make calculated gambles based on the odds of what they might draw next. This concept of building a deck to mitigate randomness, combined with its risk-versus-reward map progression, established the formula that many later "gambling roguelikes" would adopt and apply to more explicit casino themes.

### Dicey Dungeons (2019)

Created by Terry Cavanagh, *Dicey Dungeons* is a foundational "dice-building" roguelike that set the stage for many subsequent titles. Players choose one of several characters, each represented as an adorable d6, and fight monsters in turn-based combat. The main mechanic involves rolling a set of dice each turn and then strategically placing them into equipment slots to activate abilities, attacks, and defensive moves. It cleverly removes the deck of cards found in other roguelikes and replaces it with the randomness of dice rolls, forcing players to adapt their strategy on the fly to whatever numbers they roll.

### Slice & Dice (2020)

A highly-regarded dice-builder, *Slice & Dice* gives you control of a party of five heroes in a turn-based adventure. The central mechanic revolves around each hero having their own unique set of dice, which you roll each turn to determine their actions. You can lock in certain dice and re-roll others, similar to Yahtzee, to try and get the perfect combination of attacks, blocks, or special abilities. The game features immense variety, with dozens of hero classes, items, and game modes, making each run a unique tactical puzzle of managing your party's dice rolls.

### Vampire Survivors (2022)

A foundational title for the "bullet heaven" genre, *Vampire Survivors* brilliantly integrates the design philosophy of slot machines into an action-roguelike framework. The core gameplay involves surviving escalating waves of monsters that you automatically attack with your collected weapons. The "gambling" mechanic is central to its progression: each time you level up, you are presented with a random selection of new weapons or passive upgrades. This system, inspired by the developer's background in the gambling industry, creates an intensely addictive loop where you are constantly hoping for the perfect "roll" to complete your build and survive the horde.

### Poker Quest (2022)

Released before *Balatro*, *Poker Quest* is a "poker roguelike" with a focus on dungeon crawling. You navigate a map and battle enemies using poker hands to activate equipment and abilities. The main mechanic involves using hands like a pair or a straight to trigger different effects from your gear, such as swinging an axe or a sword. With numerous characters, a large variety of equipment, and deep synergies to uncover, the game offers a more traditional RPG-style progression built around a poker-based combat system.

### Circadian Dice (2022)

Considered a hidden gem by many, *Circadian Dice* is a highly intelligent "dice-building" roguelike. The game is structured around bite-sized missions where you unlock new dice and can spend money to customize their faces. The main mechanic involves this deep customization; you can capture enemies to add their abilities to your dice faces, creating powerful new tools. A unique meta-progression system allows abilities unlocked with one character to be used by all others, constantly feeding you new content and strategic ideas to tackle previous missions in entirely new ways.

### Luck be a Landlord (2023)

As one of the pioneers of the "slot machine roguelike," this game tasks players with earning enough money to pay their rent. The core mechanic is a slot machine, but instead of leaving it all to chance, you strategically add symbols to the reels. The gameplay loop revolves around selecting new symbols to add to your machine after each spin, creating powerful synergies between them to generate income. For example, a flower might be worth more if a bee is also on the reels. It masterfully turns a game of luck into one of strategic probability management and proper "deck" (or reel) building.

### Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers (2023)

This title is a quintessential "blackjack roguelike" where you crawl through dungeons and battle opponents by playing blackjack. The core of the game is trying to reach 21 without busting, but it is layered with strategic roguelike mechanics. You build a deck of cards that not only have numerical values but also special abilities that can fundamentally change the rules. These abilities might include increasing the bust limit, launching disruptive cards into your opponent's hand, or altering card suits to affect stats like health and damage, adding significant strategic depth to the classic card game.

### Endgame of Devil (2023)

In this unique twist on the "slot machine roguelike," you play as the villains defending your jewels from invading heroes. The core mechanic builds on the *Luck be a Landlord* formula by adding a combative element directly to the grid. Enemies appear on your board, and the monster units you add to your reels will interact with and attack them. The strategy comes from managing unit placement, hero positions, and powerful relics to create explosive, defensive builds across three very different playable characters, each with over a hundred unique units.

### Crop Rotation (2023)

This game is a farming-themed "slot machine roguelike" with a clever twist. You draft plants and place them randomly on your farm, creating synergies based on how they are positioned relative to other crops. The unique mechanic is its integration of an auto-battler system. Each plant has traits (e.g., "wet fruit" or "spicy herb"), and collecting multiples of the same trait grants powerful buffs. This forces you to balance adjacency bonuses with the broader auto-battler synergies to create truly explosive harvests. [Watch the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnHJWo6DfNA)

### Balatro (2024)

This "poker roguelike" became a massive indie hit by blending the rules of poker with the deep synergies of a deck-builder. Players play poker hands to score a target number of chips, but the twist comes from a vast collection of Joker cards. Each Joker provides a unique passive ability, such as adding multipliers for certain hands, converting suits, or granting extra cards. The main mechanic involves finding and combining these Jokers to create explosive "big number" builds, turning a simple pair into a hand worth millions of points through clever multiplicative and exponential scaling.

### Bingle Bingle (2024)

This game translates the high-stakes feel of a casino classic into a "roulette roguelike." The main mechanic involves spinning balls onto a roulette table to hit numbered or colored slots and earn money to meet a score goal. The strategy comes from the balls themselves, which have different properties and betting conditions associated with them. You might bet on a specific color with one ball, or a whole column with another. As you progress, you acquire unique items and relics that can manipulate the board or the balls, allowing you to create insane chain reactions and win big from what seems like pure chance.

### Die in the Dungeon (2024)

This game is a "dice-building" roguelike that draws clear inspiration from *Slay the Spire*. The core mechanic has you drafting dice into a bag, which are then drawn and rolled each turn. You then place these dice onto your character's unique board to activate abilities, attack, or defend. The game is celebrated for its highly unique boss fights and enemy mechanics, which challenge players to build powerful combinations between different dice types and game-changing relics.

### Lonestar (2024)

While the developer describes it as a turn-based battler, *Lonestar* fits the gambling roguelike mold through its core mechanics. You pilot a spaceship and fight other ships in complex, turn-based combat. The "gambling" aspect comes from rolling dice that generate colored energy. This energy is then used to activate abilities and weapons that you install within your ship's grid. The game is an engine-builder at heart, where the main mechanic involves creating a synergistic layout of abilities that can be powered by the random energy you generate each turn, leading to incredibly complex and high-damage combos.

### Cat God Ranch (2024)

*Cat God Ranch* is a wholesome and cozy take on the slot machine roguelike. Instead of fighting, you are managing a ranch of animals. The central mechanic involves selecting different classes of animals (such as carnivores, birds, or bugs) for each run. These animals are then randomly placed in your barn, and their interactions with each other generate money. With over a hundred animals and multiple character abilities and maps, the game focuses on building economic synergies between different animal types rather than combat.

### Million Monster Militia (2024)

This title is a wacky and over-the-top "slot machine roguelike" set in a post-apocalyptic United States. You fight bizarre monsters by deploying your own units onto a grid. The core mechanic is designed to make you feel like you are breaking the game on every run. The units are absurdly powerful, but the enemies are balanced to handle it, creating a constant dopamine rush of achieving huge numbers while still being challenged. Offering a choice of six different units each turn gives players a high degree of control, making it feel more strategic even as you create wildly overpowered builds.

### Super Tax City (2024)

This game creatively mashes up a city-builder with slot machine roguelike mechanics. Unlike other games in the genre, it gives you direct control over where to place your buildings, allowing you to set up perfect adjacency bonuses. The "slot machine" randomness comes from the citizens; after you build your city, the game randomizes which buildings your workers will go to. This creates an interesting tension where the main mechanic is about building a city that is efficient and synergistic enough to thrive, even when you can't control where your people will work on any given turn.
