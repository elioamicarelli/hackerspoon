# How Diesel Knights Won Kickstarter

Diesel Knights is a "Titanfall-style" multiplayer mech FPS set in a dieselpunk world, built with Unreal Engine. Development started in early 2024, and it is launching on Steam/GOG and consoles.

Diesel Knights successfully shattered its $45K kickstarter goal by the end of 2025, raising $526K (1,170%) by reviving the "Titanfall-style" mech shooter genre that AAA studios abandoned.

## The Strategy: Community over Capital
Instead of pitching traditional VCs or publishers, solo dev Xavier B. Johnson bypassed the gatekeepers with a four-step loop:
1. Build: Developed a high-quality prototype (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hBCWBOgWPE).
2. Demo: Released a playable demo on Steam around October 23, 2024.
3. Community: Launched Discord on November 13, 2025, and gathered 7,000+ fans.
4. Fund: Launched Kickstarter campaign on October 28, 2025, with a pre-validated audience.

## The Numbers
• Time to Fund: 42 minutes.
• Backers: 7,763 people (averaging $68/each).
• Development Time: Over 2 years (part-time).
• Outcome: All stretch goals hit, including console ports.

## The Takeaway
While gaming VC funding is at a decade low, player demand remains high. Diesel Knights proves that devs don't need publisher validation if they have strong community signal. For investors and platforms, this is a loud wake-up call: the most bankable projects are already hiding in plain sight.
